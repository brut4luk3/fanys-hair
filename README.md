## Fany's Hair Website

This is Fany's Hair Website, which is basically a multipage portfolio that enables her customers to see some of her work and contact her directly with everything they need, through a simple form.

While the website is #underdevelopment, you can take a look at this beautiful code to evaluate some of my skills.

# How to run the project:

-> Clone the repository
-> Install all of the dependencies with the following code:
```bash
npm install
```
-> Start the dev server with:
 ```bash
npm run dev
```
-> It's done!
